# Hydrological Tool for DEM Fill Analysis
<br>
This tool is designed to process Digital Elevation Models (DEM) for hydrological analysis by filling depressions and generating a depression-less DEM. The tool automates the following steps:
<br>
1. Identifies depressions and flat areas in the DEM. <br>
2. Performs depression filling to ensure a smooth surface.<br>
3. Outputs a depression-less DEM, ideal for hydrological modeling tasks like watershed delineation and flow path analysis.<br>

### Features
<br>
- Fully automated workflow for DEM pre-processing. <br>
- Enhanced hydrological analysis accuracy with depressionless DEM.<br>
- Built for efficient and large-scale DEM handling.<br>

### Technologies Used
<br>
- Python <br>
- GIS libraries (e.g., GDAL, Rasterio, NumPy, etc.) <br>

This tool streamlines DEM processing for hydrological applications and improves workflow efficiency. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
